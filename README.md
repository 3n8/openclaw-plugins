# OpenClaw Plugins

Plugins for the OpenClaw project, either created by me or patched locally because I do not want to wait for a busy upstream project to merge changes.

## Layout

- `matrix-plugin/` - Matrix channel plugin source (vendored copy for local patching)

## Notes

- This repo may contain patched versions before upstream changes land.
- Validate changes against your running OpenClaw gateway/channel behavior before deploying.
